
Mixer
=====


A mixer mixes two input material streams (:math:`In1`, :math:`In2`) into the one output stream (:math:`Out`), as shown in the scheme below.

The output stream will be defined for all time points for which the streams :math:`In1` and :math:`In2` are defined. Mixing of more streams can be implemented by connecting of several mixers sequentially.

The parameters of output stream are calculated as:

.. math::

		\dot{m}_{out} &= \dot{m}_{in1}+\dot{m}_{in2}
		
		T_{out} &= \frac{ T_{in1}\,\dot{m}_{in1} + T_{in2}\,\dot{m}_{in2}}{\dot{m}_{out} } 
		
		P_{out} &= min( P_{in1},P_{in2} )


where :math:`\dot{m}` is a mass flow, :math:`T` is a temperature and :math:`P` is a pressure.

All secondary attributes of output stream, such as phase fractions, compounds fractions and multidimensional distributions are calculating depending on mass fractions of input streams.

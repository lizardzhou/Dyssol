First step
----------

In order to edit this documentation with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) , you should [install](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html) it on your computer.

A [quickstart](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html) option is available in Sphinx for quick setting up of a new documentation, which is already implemented in Dyssol documentation.


Edit the documentation
----------------------

In the python [configuration](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html?highlight=conf#module-conf) file `conf.py` located in folder `source`, you can adjust different properties for the documentation such as theme, page layout and extensions for rendering of sepcial formats (like mathematical formula).

The `.rst` file with reStructuredText markup language is applied in Sphinx for editing the pages.
